Christians from indigenous communities are severely persecuted in the Mexican state of Chiapas. This, combined with widespread illiteracy, has left the Tzotzil and Tzeltal churches in desperate need of Audio Bibles.

Digital Bible Society has partnered with missionaries on the ground who are actively working with the Tzotzil and Tzeltal indigenous groups. Audio Bibles will be distributed at a gathering for hundreds of indigenous believers. Our goal is to supply 100 Tzotzil and 300 Tzeltal audio players for our brothers and sisters to engage with Godâ€™s Word and be strengthened in their faith.

**Total Funding: $12,00.00**

Media Costs: $10,000.00  
Travel Costs: $1,300.00  
Follow Up Costs: $700.00  
Funding (Total) $12,000.00

Please email projects@dbs.org and reference Project ID: 4-1-001 to help us fund this distribution.

We invite you to watch the video below to see the impact of previous distributions among persecuted Christians in Chiapas, Mexico.
