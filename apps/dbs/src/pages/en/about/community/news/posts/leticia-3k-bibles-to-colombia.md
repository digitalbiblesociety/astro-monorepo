excerpt: 'Goals of Distribution: The Christian indigenous communities in the Leticia area face persecution from both the armed forces that are trying to gain power in Colombia and members of their indigenous group who see them as brining bad luck due to their conversion. They need God’s Word to strengthen their faith and be encouraged. This is being accomplished through this distribution.'

**Goals of Distribution:** The Christian indigenous communities in the Leticia area face persecution from both the armed forces that are trying to gain power in Colombia and members of their indigenous group who see them as brining bad luck due to their conversion. They need God’s Word to strengthen their faith and be encouraged. This is being accomplished through this distribution.

**Testimony:** We expect to receive more testimonies from the field in 2022. We are grateful for that God opened the way for the Bibles to reach Leticia. Frequent flooding along the Amazon River made it difficult to ensure their safe arrival via canoe and boat. Despite some delays, all the Bibles arrived safely and distribution has begun.
