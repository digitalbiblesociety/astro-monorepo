Violent torture is one of the many tactics used by Hindu extremists to force new followers of Christ to abandon their faith and return to a religion of oppression and darkness. Generational poverty and pervasive illiteracy aggravate this persecution, leaving new believers vulnerable as they try to believe in God’s goodness. Despite the persistence of extremists and the social isolation that often accompanies walking with Jesus, millions of people in the Indian state of Odisha are choosing to follow Christ.

The Elijah Challenge is fervently working to spread God’s Word and display the  
power of the Gospel. The need for audio Bibles has become more evident than  
ever. Miracles are being witnessed, yet the Scriptures are needed to strengthen  
new disciples. Digital Bible Society and The Elijah Challenge will provide believers  
from remote villages in the state of Odisha with God’s Word in their heart  
language. They will be encouraged, and strengthened to stand firm in their faith  
amidst extreme persecution.
