The Shuar people are an indigenous tribe living in the tropical rainforests,  
lowlands, and savannas of Ecuador. Climate change and multinational  
corporations have long posed a threat to the people of the Amazon rainforest.  
Now, however, the region’s indigenous tribes face an even more immediate  
danger: coronavirus. Local ministries serving the Shuar during this pandemic have  
seen the need for Audio Bibles to strengthen the Shuar believers. These  
communities are often illiterate, making Audio Bibles the only way for them to  
engage with God’s Word.

Digital Bible Society, in partnership with the Latin American Evangelical Bible  
Alliance (ABEL), will provide Digital Audio Bibles for Christian workers laboring  
among the Shuar. These Solar powered Audio Bibles will be hand delivered to  
believers living in the remote Shuar villages of Ecuador. They will be strengthened  
to hope in God and continue following Christ.

**Total Funding Needed: $3,100.00**

Estimated Impact: 100 Audio Bibles enabling 1,000+ indigenous people to engage in the truths of God’s Word

$2,500.00  
Travel Costs: $500  
Follow Up Costs: $100  
Funding (Total) $3,100.00
