### Bible Content by Libraries
The Digital Bible Society gathers, prepares and shares Bible Content for free distribution in over a thousand language. Working with content creators from around the world, we secure permission, prepare content, create media and share with Christian workers to insure fluid distribution. We also report to donors and content creators about the process.

We create several types of Libraries:

- Bible Libraries with a variety of Bible content (text, audio and video Bibles)
- Treasures Libraries with Bibles with collections of other Christian resources.
- Custom Libraries - one of our existing libraries with your content added (special orders only).

Bible and Treasures Libraries make it possible for everyone to share Bibles, video, audio Scriptures, and books with people they are ministering to or the neighbors next door in a way that is safe, cost effective, and comprehensive.

### Bible Libraries (For Mobile Applications)
The mobile friendly Bible Libraries are a great choice for regions where desktop use is unlikely. They are targeted for Android users, but will also work on desktops, and contain PDF and HTML Bibles, Audio Bibles, Movies, and Android Apps.

There are a number of Bible Libraries that contain content that is provided for distribution outside of North America. Please let us know ehn ordering Bible Libraries for distribution in the US or Canada.

### Treasures Libraries (For Desktop Applications)

Treasures Libraries reflect the content and generosity of many organizations, and are free-to-copy. The resources in each library vary considerably, based on the content contributed.

The Treasures Libraries are generally intended for regions where installing software or copying volumes of Christian content might be considered dangerous, if not illegal. Consequently, the Treasures Libraries have been created to run on an ordinary web browser without installed software.

- Language-specific digital libraries that consist of Bibles, audio Scriptures, commentaries, books, movies, and music.
- Some libraries are as large as 16 GB and contain thousands of resources.
- Designed and indexed for a wide range of uses.
- Available for the cost of media. Downloads are available by request.
