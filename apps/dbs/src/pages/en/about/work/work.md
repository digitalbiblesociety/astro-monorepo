### The Literacy Factor

Jesus told his disciples, “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age (Matthew 28:19–20).“

According to the World Literacy Foundation, 1 in 5 people are completely illiterate while nearly half of the world's population struggle with basic level reading and writing. The impact of which upon economic, social, and health issues is massive.

Jesus said to those who believed, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you will know the truth and the truth shall make you free (John 8:31).“

With the twentieth-century advent of recording media, many great organizations have sought to record the Gospel message in the world's 7900 languages. And by the 21st century, audio Gospel recorders were recorded in over 6000 languages. With Audio Bibles recorded in over 1700+ languages, it is becoming increasingly easier, and cost effective, to deliver the riches of God's Word to the functionally illiterate.

Jesus said to his followers, “And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come (Matthew 24:14).“

For the first time, it is reasonable to believe that the promise of Christ to publish the Gospel among all nations, can be realized in our lifetime. Working with amazing organizations such as Faith Comes by Hearing, Davar Partners, and Global Recordings Network, the Digital Bible Society is incorporating critical audio Bibles and recordings into Bible Libraries, apps, multiple websites for free and widespread distribution.
