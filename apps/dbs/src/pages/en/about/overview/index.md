_The Digital Bible Society is a non-profit 501(c)3 ministry working with the Body of Christ to produce and distribute digital Bibles and Christian resources that promote discipleship, evangelism, and church planting around the world._

## The Digital Revolution

Every major industry has changed. Communications, banking, entertainment, commerce, transportation, manufacturing, and publishing have all been transformed by the Digital Revolution.

The digital revolution, however, has not changed the deep inner need in every heart to know God. People around the world are searching for answers to life’s burning questions, and—more than ever before—are finding them in Christ Jesus.

At the turn of the 19th century, there were less than one million Christians in China. By the turn of the 20th century, that number exceeded 100 million. In 1900, the church in Africa numbered less than 9 million. By 2025, there will be an estimated 625 million African Christians. The growth of Christianity in the Middle East has been likewise explosive, especially in Iran, a country where there is extreme persecution against Christians. The growth rate of the Persian church is estimated to be at 20% per year since 2012 and climbing. All of these burgeoning communities have one thing in common, the need for Biblical resources and training materials so that new believers will not only be able to grow in their faith but share it with others.

With the digital revolution now reaching into every corner of the world, it is now possible for every person in any country, speaking whatever language, can access the Biblical resources they need. This is the goal to which the Digital Bible Society had been working since 2001 and, with your help, will continue to accomplish until everyone has full access to the Bible and Christian resources in their own language.

## Digital Bible Publishing

In spite of the digital revolution and globalization, nearly half of the world’s population is still without ready access to the Bible in any language, much less their own. Furthermore, two thirds live in countries where government censorship prevents them from purchasing one.

The Digital Bible Society aims to remedy this by freely distributing the Bible and other Christian resources on SD chips, flash drives, DVDs, hard drives, solar-powered audio players, projectors, old fashioned ink on paper, and anything at our disposal. Basically, we use any media at our disposal to replicate and allocate the Word of God.

Partnerships with over 170 content providers enable us to legally provide the Church abroad with the critical resources she so desperately needs and in a timely manner.

Since 2001, the Digital Bible Society and its partners have compiled twenty-five language libraries and distributed hundreds of millions of Christian resources all over the world. We have created libraries in Chinese, Arabic, Farsi, Hindi, Spanish, and many other languages. These libraries are free-to-copy and free-to-distribute with the intent of leveraging the power of the digital revolution toward the widespread publishing of the Gospel of Christ.

We also distribute our resources over the internet. The Digital Bible Society produces Find-a-Bible (www.Find.Bible) which is helping people around the world discover, secure and distribute Bibles and resources for a wide variety of uses. in addition, over a thousand Bible versions that have been long out-of-print, are now available at cost online through Print-on-Demand.

All of our materials are made available to churches, mission agencies, church planters, teachers, leaders and disciple-makers and are are free-of charge or provided at the cost of production. The Digital Bible Society subsists because of the generous assistance of our donors. Your partnership, be it in the form of financial gifts, prayers, or the hands-on distribution of Christian resources, enables us to continue the work of fulfilling The Great Commission.
