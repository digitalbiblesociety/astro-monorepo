_Because we believe that Christ “came so that everyone would have life, and have it in its fullest” (John 10:10), and because we have experienced the life-giving power of His Words, (John 6:63), and because God has called us to share those Words, we will pursue the following values:_

### Make Scripture Accessible

The Holy Scriptures will be the centerpiece of all of our projects. We will make them accessible to all people, regardless of language, culture, or religion.

### Prioritize the Persecuted

Persecuted regions and nations will remain highest priority in our work. We will not be afraid to stand up for them.

### Serve Missionaries

We will not dictate content to missionaries but rather listen to their requests and strive to fulfill their needs. There will be no one-size-fits-all approach and so we will strive to make our work as accessible as possible: be it Print on Demand Bibles, digital scriptures, video scriptures, or solar powered audio scripture devices.

### Responsible stewardship

Recognizing that content we share is provided by the generous contributions of our partners, DBS will never profit by the sale of digital material entrusted to our care. We are also a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Which means we have an independent Board of Directors along with yearly financial Audits.

### Listen to Local Believers

We aim to develop strong relationships with the church at home and abroad. We strive to separate Scripture and our own culture, so what we never conflate the two. We will prioritize missionaries who study the culture they are entering and to allow for indigenous expressions of faith, while maintaining the good news of the Gospel.

### Persist in Prayer

Mindful prayer will guide our actions and help us to maintain a spirit of humility. We commit ourselves to serving others, considering their interests above our own. Only through prayer can we disavow selfish ambition and heal the strife that comes from prideful self-justification. We cannot stand up for the Church if we stand divided.

### Work in Partnership

Content entrusted to the Digital Bible Society for distribution remains the sole property of the contributor, including any alteration or digital improvements made by our organization or their partners. Only content that is freely shared or public domain is included in our libraries to ensure they are freely available to all.

### Avoid Controversy and Division

We seek to avoid areas of historic division within the Church and submit to the standards and principles of the Lausanne Covenant. We will not distribute material that is contains polemics against our brothers and sisters within the larger Christian community or material that contains unwarranted political and scientific bias.
