_Because of the diverse backgrounds of our team, partners, and contributors, we regard ourselves as inter-denominational. We are Protestant theologically and Evangelical in practice. And, while we do not agree on everything, we fully agree on this:_

### We believe in one God, the Father
We believe in one God, the Father,  the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen, who, though being one, is revealed in Scripture as a Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We believe He is All-Knowing (omniscience), All-Powerful (omniscience), Supremely Good and Just (omnibenevolent), Perfect in Holiness, Sovereign, Unchangeable and Incomparable.

_(Genesis 1:1-31, Isaiah 40:25-28, Matthew. 28:18–19, John 1:14, Acts 5:3–4, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Hebrews 1:1–3, Revelation 1:4–6)._

### We believe Jesus Christ is Lord,
We believe Jesus Christ is Lord,  His absolute deity and virgin birth, His real and perfect manhood, the authority of His teaching, the infallibility of His utterances, His work of atonement for sin by His suffering and death, His bodily resurrection and ascension into Heaven, His present high-priestly intercession for His people, His Lordship over the Church as its supreme Head, and His triumphant return at the end of this age.

_(Luke 1:30–35, 2:40, John 1:1–2, John 1:18, 1:29, 3:16, Romans 3:25–26, 2 Corinthians 5:14, Ephesians 1:22–23, Philippians 2:5–8, Hebrews. 1:3, 4:15, 7:25, 10:5–14, 1 Peter 3:18)._

### We believe in the Holy Spirit,
We believe in the Holy Spirit,  the giver of life, who with the Father and the Son ought to be worshiped and glorified. He proceeds from the Father and the Son and is sent to comfort, teach, direct, edify, inspire, convict and empower people to know and love God, proclaim the gospel, experience God's Kingdom and live transformed lives.

_(Luke 24:49, John 14:16–17, 16:7–15, Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 3:16, Ephesians 3:16, 1 Thessalonians 1:5, 1 John 2:27)._

### We believe the Bible–both the Old and New Testament–to be the inspired,
We believe the Bible–both the Old and New Testament–to be the inspired,  infallible, sufficient, and authoritative Word of God; and that it doesn't only contain the Word of God but that it is the Word of God. We believe that God the Father has first given the Holy Spirit, second, the testimony of history, and, third, the evidence of the created world to inform a sober reading of Scripture.

_(Luke 24:27, 44, Acts 17:2–3, 26:22–23, 28:23, Romans. 15:4, 2Ti. 3:16, 2Pe 1:21)._

### We believe that the Church is central
We believe that the Church is central  to God's purposes and is made up of all who unite in faith. We also believe that the united gathering of believers for edification, inspiration, instruction and prayer is primary to the purposes of God and is central to the work of His Kingdom.

_(Matthew 16:16–18, Acts 2:42–47, 1 Corinthians 12:12–27, Ephesians 1:20–23, 4:3–10, Colossians 3:14–15)._

### We believe that the Great Commission is a call to all believers.
We believe that the Great Commission is a call to all believers. We believe that we, as Christians, are called to intensive and deliberate evangelism in accordance with the Great Commission. We believe that the unity of believers, the prayers of the saints, and the universal distribution of Scripture are critical to such work.

_(Matthew 9:36-38, 24:14, 28:18–19, Mark 16:15, John 17:18, Acts 1:8, 2 Corinthians 5:18–20)._

### We believe that Jesus saves sinners
We believe that Jesus saves sinners and freely gives them the gift of eternal life in a literal heaven, and that all mankind is fallen and in desperate need of this saving grace. We believe that salvation comes only through repentance and faith in the person and sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

_(John 1:12, 3:16–18, 3:36, 5:24, Romans 1:16-17, 5:6–9, Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5, James 1:18, 1 John 5:11-12)._

### We believe in the resurrection
We believe in the resurrection of the dead and the reality of eternal happiness in Heaven for the saved and eternal punishment for the lost in Hell. We soberly await the personal return of our Lord Jesus Christ and His final judgment of all mankind.

_(Matthew 24:29-31, John 14:1–3, 1 Corinthians 15:51–52, Philippians 3:20, 1 Thessalonians 4:14-18, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Titus 2:11–14, 2 Peter 3:9-13, Revelation 20:1-3, 11-15)._
