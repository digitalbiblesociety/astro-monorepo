## Our Mission
The Digital Bible Society exists to gather, prepare and distribute Biblical resources in the languages of the world. God is calling us to link Bible translators, content creators, donors and distributors to insure that Biblical resources are available in a variety of ways to people who need them most.

With a primary focus on persecuted regions, the Digital Bible Society leverages emerging technologies to insure that the Word of God is readily accessible and can 'grow and multiply around the world' (Acts 12:24).

## Our Vision
We believe that God is using the digital revolution to supply the Body of Christ with the resources necessary to advance discipleship, evangelism and church planting more effectively and efficiently than ever before.

We expect that before the year 2025, new technologies will completely resolve the linguistic and logistical problems that have crippled discipleship, evangelism, and church-planting in closed-access countries for so long.

We anticipate that within the next two decades, the Bible will have been translated, recorded, filmed and readily accessible in every living language of the world.
