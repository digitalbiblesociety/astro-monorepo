## About Digital Bible Society Libraries
### What is the difference between a Treasures Library and a Bible Library?
A Treasures Library is a collection of Bibles, Christian books, reference works, audio resources, and videos that assists the user in their own personal devotions and Bible studies. A Bible Library consists of available Bibles (in multiple formats), an Audio Bible, and Gospel Films - intended primarily . Treasures library consists of material from multiple ministries and is generally divided to address the needs of the users be they Enquirers, New Believers, Families, Children, Discipleship trainers or trainees and Leaders. Both libraries are free-to-copy and free-to-share.

### How do you determine what content goes into a Treasures Library?
We identify trusted experts, and respected leaders who understand their cultures and languages. We trust them to decide on the content that will best serve the regions we are serving. And,place the highest priority on Scripture content. The Digital Bible Society has chosen to remain neutral with regards to selecting content for our libraries.

### What denomination is the Digital Bible Society affiliated with?
Our staff and board of directors is made up of several Christian denominations and persuasions. However, we avoid including any material in any of our libraries that may be considered cultic, divisive or exclusive.

### How can I get involved in a particular project?
You can support us by prayer, funding or by sponsoring a language (gathering resources, securing permissions, doing distributions or translations). If you are prolific at programming, web design, or data management, please contact us.

### What software is required for libraries?
No software installation is required. These libraries are intended to run directly from the media and can be accessed through a web browser or a file manager by which means the user can access the content directly. We recommend that users install the Mp3 Bibles (or videos) directly to their players of phones for ease of access.

## Sharing and Copying
### What is the best media on which to distribute DBS libraries?
This depends on your target audience. If you are seeking to support users who have access to computers, DVDs are cost effective but are quickly growing obsolete. If you want to deliver Bibles that will work on tablets, mobile phones, or pocket projectors, Micro SDs are best. Still others prefer the flexibility and durability of flash storage and order Treasures Libraries on USB drives. Many prefer to carry several libraries on a single hard drive.

### Can I copy and share Digital Bible Society products?
The Digital Bible Society Treasures libraries were created with copying and sharing in mind and are intended to alleviate the problem of Bible poverty by supplying resources in areas where they may be scarce or inaccessible. Copying Treasures Libraries is encouraged so long as the copies are distributed to the region for which they were created. Treasures libraries must never be sold. Agencies directly partnering with a Digital Bible Alliance member may, in some circumstances, recover the cost of the media used to deliver the libraries.

### What devices do Treasures USBs, Micro SD chips work with?
Technology continues and will continue to evolve. Micro SD chips are useful for Android based cell phones and tablets and will work on computers if you have a card reader on on your computer or an adapter that can turn a Micro SD into a USB. Digital Bible Society Treasures DVDs and USBs work on computers that have DVD drives. But Treasures Libraries on SD are no longer as compatible with new security trends on mobile devices. Bible libraries work better for mobile devices.

### Do Treasures Libraries leave any evidence of usage?
Digital Bible Society Treasures libraries leave little trace on users’ devices – unless, of course, the user opts to install a library, Bible or App onto their device. Moreover, devices and operating system vary in how data is stored. If a user is concerned with security, we recommend they clear their browser history or reset their browser just to be sure. If you are in a high security area, please take the time to educate yourself as to how your particular device or system handles history and caching of files. An excellent source of information is StaySafeOnline.org or Google Online Safety.

### What do I need to know about copying to Micro SD?
DBS libraries can be freely copied but not sold. The actual size of a Micro SD chip is usually about 10 percent smaller than advertised. Each brand is a little different. The Class rating represents speed. Only use chips that are Class 6 or better, but never lower than Class 4. The library, especially the videos, will otherwise run too slowly. The best way to copy a library onto an SD chip is to copy all the files of a library to a folder on your computer, then copy the folder to the Micro SD.

## Usage and Publishing
### How can I install an entire Treasures Library to a computer or device?
When possible, we do suggest that users install the entire library to their devices – if it is safe to do so –this will cause it to run much faster. Simply make a directory on your device, name it something appropriate, and copy all the files from the Treasures Library media device into that directory. When done, check to make sure that the number of files on your media matches the number of files in your new directory. It always helps to make a shortcut to that directory and launch the file called index.html

### What products can NOT be copied and shared?
The Digital Bible Society has a few products that should not be copied, such as special Spanish versions. This is because of royalty arrangements and proper counting. Check the labeling and the Treasures About pages before copying.

### Can I copy off and use portions of a Digital Bible Society library?
Users may remove and use a given resource for personal use. In honor of the Content Creators users should not distribute or upload to the internet content contained in DBS libraries. Distribution of modified libraries is prohibited.

### Can you make Micro SD chips so that they cannot be erased?
Yes. When ordering in bulk (20 or more), you can specify that we make them read only–so that they can neither be formatted or copied over. If you would like to order a number of chips that are read only, let us know and will provide them protected.

### Can I print and distribute materials on the Treasures Libraries?
Yes, printing and sharing is encouraged, provided that such materials are not sold or used for any commercial purpose.

### Is it OK to change or customize the libraries or re-publish content?
No changes or alteration may be made to Libraries without the written consent of the Digital Bible Society. We will never authorize the use of another's ministry content. Please contact that ministry directly for permissions.
