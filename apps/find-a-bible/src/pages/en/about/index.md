#### The Project
Find-A-Bible (FAB) is a web directory providing links to Bibles and biblical resources in the 7000+ languages of the world. The FAB directory primarily consists of content created by members of the Forum of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI) and is intended to help users discover and obtain Scriptures and biblical resources in the language and media of their choice for discipleship, evangelism, and church planting.  Find-A-Bible also features links to print Bibles, print-on-demand Bibles, digital Bibles, audio Bibles, visual Bibles and Bible resources – in multiple formats. Find-A-Bible is a collaborative project by the Forum of Bible Agencies International built to increase the Bible's accessibility and to facilitate access to scripture. The Find-A-Bible design, interphase, and database was created and is maintained by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org).

#### Data Sources
Find-A-Bible exists to provide tools that simplify the discovery of existing Bible resources. Find-A-Bible also exists to inform missions workers of what languages they may likely encounter in given regions and then to equip them with resources that will serve their mission.  Toward those goals, Find-A-Bible draws upon data derived from a wide variety of reliable open sources, and in some case uses calculates averages and best estimates for determining numbers. Consequently, **Find-A-Bible should NOT be considered a definitive source for global and linguistic data and statistics**. For reliable and authoritative data, we strongly recommend you refer to the latest version of the [SIL Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/books) (or subscribe to [Ethnologue.com](https://www.ethnologue.com/)), or member agencies of the [United Bible Societies](https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/). Find-A-Bible consists of four data sets (Bibles, Languages, Countries and Agencies) that are built upon two data frameworks: the [SIL 639-3 Language Codes](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data) and the [ISO-3166 International Standard Country Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html). **Bible Resource Data** Bible information and data is compiled by the [Digital Bible Society](https://dbs.org/) with significant contributions from a number of API data streams including: [Digital Bible Library](https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/), [Faith Comes by Hearing](https://www.faithcomesbyhearing.com/audio-bible-resources/bible-brain), [The Jesus Film Project](https://www.jesusfilm.org/), [Global Recordings Network](https://globalrecordings.net/), [Wycliffe Bible Translators](https://www.wycliffe.org/), [YouVersion](https://youversion.com/), and others. **Language Data:** Language statistics, population and language data is derived largely from the following sources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers), [Joshua Project](https://joshuaproject.net/), [Ethnologue (16th edition primarily)](https://www.ethnologue.com/), [the Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/), the [WorldFact Book](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), the [Digital Bible Society](https://www.dbs.org/), and others.

#### Find-A-Bible Conference

**Country Data:** Country statistics and information is gathered from a variety of source including: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area), [Joshua Project Datasets](https://joshuaproject.net/resources/datasets), [OpenDoors International](https://www.opendoors.org/persecution/countries/), [Operation World](https://operationworld.org/), [WorldFact Book](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), [the United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/library/page/databases) and others. The Country specific language data is often averaged among research sources and should only be considered "best guess" estimates. Our goal is simply to show what languages workers will most likely encountered in a given country.  Mapping data is drawn from the [WorldFact Book, ](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/)[the Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/), [Muturzikin.com](https://www.muturzikin.com/), [The Perry-Castañeda Library](https://maps.lib.utexas.edu/maps/index.html), and others.

**Agency Data:** Data regarding organization information is collected by the [Forum of Bible Agencies](https://forum-intl.org/) and the [Digital Bible Society](https://dbs.org/). Data is also provided by the organizations themselves or their associated websites. [Learn More](https://forum-intl.org/)
